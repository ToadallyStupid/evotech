## Contributing
For information on how to contribute to the project, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

## Running locally
These instructions will guide you through setting up the project to run locally on your machine for development and testing purposes.
### Windows

1. Install XAMPP
    ```powershell
    winget install -e --id ApacheFriends.Xampp.8.2
    ```

2. Clone the repository using `git clone` and change directory to the root of the repository
    ```powershell
    cd evotech
    ```

3. Run the setup script for Windows
    ```powershell
    .\setup\setupWindows.ps1
    ```
    - This will also start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP and launch the sites

The script will have configured everything so in the future if you need to run locally again:

1. Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP

2. Open the following links in your browser:
    - http://localhost/phpmyadmin
    - http://localhost

To use the website, you will need to construct the database as per the instructions in [Constructing the database](#constructing-the-database).

### macOS

1. Install xcode command line tools
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```

2. Install brew
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh) NONINTERACTIVE=1"
    ```
3. Install XAMPP
    ```bash
    brew install --cask xampp
    ```
    
4. Clone the repository using `git clone` and change directory to the root of the repository
    ```bash
    cd evotech
    ```
5. Run the setup script for macOS
    ```bash
    ./setup/setupMac.sh
    ```
    - This will also start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP and launch the sites

The script will have configured everything so in the future if you need to run locally again:

1. Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP

2. Open the following links in your browser:
    - http://localhost/phpmyadmin
    - http://localhost

To use the website, you will need to construct the database as per the instructions in [Constructing the database](#constructing-the-database).

### Linux

1. Install XAMPP
    ```bash
    wget "https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Linux/8.2.12/xampp-linux-x64-8.2.12-0-installer.run"
    chmod +x xampp-linux-x64-8.2.12-0-installer.run
    sudo ./xampp-linux-x64-8.2.12-0-installer.run
    ```

2. Clone the repository using `git clone`

3. Run the setup script for Linux
    ```bash
    ./setup/setupLinux.sh
    ```
    - This will also start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP and launch the sites

The script will have configured everything so in the future if you need to run locally again:

1. Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP

2. Open the following links in your browser:
    - http://localhost/phpmyadmin
    - http://localhost

To use the website, you will need to construct the database as per the instructions in [Constructing the database](#constructing-the-database).

## Constructing the database
The database needs to be constructed before the website can be used.

1. Open the following link in your browser:
    - http://localhost/phpmyadmin
2. Log in with your MySQL credentials
    - Default username: `root`
    - Default password: `''` (empty string)
3. The database name is your username followed by '_db'
    - For example, if your username is `root`, the database name is `root_db`
4. Click on the `SQL` tab
5. Open the `evotechDB.sql` file in the `setup` directory
6. Copy the contents of the file and paste them into the SQL tab
7. Click `Go` to run the SQL commands


## Using supplied dummy data
The database can be populated with dummy data to test the website.

### SQL Product Data

This will populate the database with dummy product data.
The site **requires** some products to be present in the database to function correctly.

1. Open the following link in your browser:
    - http://localhost/phpmyadmin
2. Log in with your MySQL credentials
    - Default username: `root`
    - Default password: `''` (empty string)
3. Ensure you have created the database as per the instructions in [Constructing the database](#constructing-the-database)
4. Click on the database name 
    - The database name is your username followed by '_db'
    - For example, if your username is `root`, the database name is `root_db`
5. Click on the `SQL` tab
6. Open the `dummyProductData.sql` file in the `setup` directory
7. Copy the contents of the file and paste them into the SQL tab
8. Click `Go` to run the SQL commands

### Image Product Data

This will populate the `images` directory with dummy product images.
Whilst not necessary for the site to function, it will make the site look more realistic.

1. Copy the image folders inside of `setup/examplePhotos/products` to `view/images/products`
    - For example, `setup/examplePhotos/products/1` should be copied to `view/images/products/1`
    - This can be done using the file explorer or the command line
